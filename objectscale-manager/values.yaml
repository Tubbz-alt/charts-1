# A customer provided log server can be used for external log aggregation.
# This receiver will be forwarded all ECS platform logs from any ECS instance
# deployed by the operator. If "logReceiver.create" is enabled, then a
# syslog-based receiver will be created, and other connectivity configuration
# options will be ignored.
# If log receiver configuration is not provided then ECS logs will be redirected to stdout
logReceiver:
  # The type of log receiver that ECS Flex will use to consolidate logs. Valid
  # are: "Syslog" and "Elasticsearch".  When using a "Syslog" receiver, you can
  # optionally instruct ECS Flex to create a syslog receiver.  In the case of
  # Elasticsearch, the administrator is expected to create the cluster, and then
  # provide connectivity details in the "logReceiver" configuration block below.
